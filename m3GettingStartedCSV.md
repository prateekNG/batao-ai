"Problem Statement","Option1","Option2","Option3","Option4"
"What is the primary function of npm (Node Package Manager)?","It provides a repository of pre-built JavaScript modules and libraries that you can easily incorporate into your projects.","It allows you to write and execute JavaScript code directly in your web browser.","It converts JavaScript code into a format that web browsers can understand.","It helps optimize the performance of your JavaScript code."
"What is the main difference between a compiler and an interpreter?","A compiler translates code all at once, while an interpreter translates code line by line.","A compiler is used for high-level programming languages, while an interpreter is used for low-level programming languages.","A compiler is faster than an interpreter.","A compiler creates an executable file, while an interpreter does not."
"What is the purpose of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)?","To offer tools that simplify writing, testing, and debugging code. ","To provide a platform for running compiled code.","To help developers design user interfaces.","To store and manage large datasets."
"You encounter a new JavaScript library that seems perfect for your project.  What is the most likely way you would incorporate this library into your project?","Use npm to install the library and manage its dependencies.","Manually copy and paste the library's code into your project.","Ask the library's developers to integrate it into your project for you.","Download the library's source code and compile it yourself." 
"What is the role of Node.js in JavaScript programming?","It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.","It is a JavaScript library for creating animations.","It is a web browser specifically designed for running JavaScript.","It converts JavaScript code into binary code."
"Why is understanding binary logic important in programming?","Computers use binary logic to process and understand instructions.","All programming languages are written in binary code.","Programmers need to be able to write binary code to create software.","Binary logic is only important for developing hardware, not software."
"Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of JavaScript?","It requires a separate IDE to write and run code.","It is primarily used for front-end web development.","It is an interpreted language.","It can be used with Node.js to build server-side applications."
"A developer wants to test a small piece of JavaScript code to see its output. What tool within a web browser would be most efficient for this task?","The console in developer tools","The elements tab in developer tools","The network tab in developer tools","The sources tab in developer tools "
"Imagine you are building a simple web application that displays a welcome message when a button is clicked. Why would you use JavaScript in this scenario?","To add interactivity to the webpage and make the button functional in response to user clicks.","To connect the webpage to a database.","To style the button and make it visually appealing.","To store the welcome message as a variable."
"Which of the following is the MOST accurate analogy for the relationship between a programming language and a computer?","A programming language is like a set of instructions written in a language a computer understands, allowing us to tell it what to do.","A programming language is like a brain for the computer, enabling it to think and solve problems.","A programming language is like a power source for the computer, giving it the energy to run applications.","A programming language is like a game controller, allowing us to interact with the computer in a fun and engaging way."
"What is the PRIMARY reason we use binary logic in computers?","Computers are built using electronic components that have two states (on/off), which can be represented by binary digits (0/1).","Binary logic enables computers to communicate with each other over the internet.","Binary logic is the easiest type of logic for humans to understand and work with.","Binary logic allows computers to store vast amounts of data in a very small space."
