    c) Binary logic allows computers to store vast amounts of data in a very small space.
    d) Binary logic enables computers to communicate with each other over the internet.

**3.  What is the main difference between a compiler and an interpreter?**

    a) **A compiler translates code all at once, while an interpreter translates code line by line.**
    b) A compiler is used for high-level programming languages, while an interpreter is used for low-level programming languages.
    c) A compiler is faster than an interpreter.
