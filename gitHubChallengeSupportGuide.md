## üë´ Buddy Up for Git & GitHub Challenge! üë´

Let's get started! This challenge will help you get comfortable using Git and GitHub with a buddy.  You'll learn how to:

* Create and fork repositories
* Manage branches
* Make pull requests
* Merge code changes

**Before you start:**

1. **Find a partner!** You'll both need GitHub accounts.
2. **Decide who will be Partner A and Partner B.**  Partner A will create the original repository.

---

### Part 1: Setting Up the Project (Partner A)

**Partner A, it's your turn first!**

1. **Create a new repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub homepage and click the green "New" button.
   - Name your repository something fun, like "git-challenge" or "awesome-project".
   - You can keep it public.
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of creating a new repo on GitHub)**
   - Click "Create repository"!

2. **Clone the repository to your computer:**
   - On your repository page, click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL.
   - Open your terminal/command prompt.
   - Type `git clone <paste your repository URL here>` and press Enter.
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of copying the repository URL and using git clone in the terminal)**

3. **Create a `.gitignore` file (Optional but Recommended):**
   - In your terminal, navigate to your new repository's directory: `cd <your repository name>`
   - Create a `.gitignore` file: `touch .gitignore`
   - Open this file in a text editor and add patterns to exclude files you don't want to track (e.g., `*.log`, `node_modules/`). This keeps your repository clean and focused.
   -  **(Add Image: Example of a simple .gitignore file)**

4. **Create a new branch for your feature:**
   - In your terminal: `git checkout -b featureA`
   - **Tip:** Use descriptive branch names for real-world projects (e.g., "add-login-feature", "fix-homepage-layout")
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of terminal showing navigating to the directory and creating a new branch)** 

5. **Now, share your repository link with Partner B and relax! They'll take it from here.**

### Part 2: Forking and Branching (Partner B)

**Alright Partner B, time to shine!**

1. **Fork the repository:**
   - Go to your Partner A's repository page on GitHub (they shared the link, right?).
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner.
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of forking a repository on GitHub)**
   - You now have a copy of the repository under your GitHub account!

2. **Clone your forked repository:**
   - Just like Partner A did, copy the HTTPS URL of **your forked repository**.
   - Open your terminal/command prompt.
   - Type `git clone <paste your forked repository URL here>` and press Enter.
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of copying the forked repository URL and cloning it in the terminal)**

3. **Create a new branch for your feature:**
   - Navigate to your forked repository's directory: `cd <your forked repository name>`
   - Create a branch: `git checkout -b featureB` 
   - **Tip:** Use descriptive branch names, just like Partner A!
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of terminal showing navigating to the directory and creating featureB branch)**

### Part 3: Building Awesome Features (Both Partners)

**It's coding time! Both partners will now work simultaneously.**

1. **Make your changes:**
   - **Partner A:** Stay on the "featureA" branch and add your amazing code. 
   - **Partner B:** Stay on the "featureB" branch and build your fantastic feature.
   - Be creative! You can add new files, modify existing ones, whatever your project needs.

2. **Commit your changes:**
   - **Both Partners:** Remember these commands:
      -  `git add <filename>` (to stage changes in a specific file)
      -  `git add . ` (to stage all changes)
      -  `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"` (to save your changes with a message)
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of the terminal showing using git add and git commit commands)**
   - Make frequent commits with clear messages to track your progress.

3. **Push your branch to GitHub:**
   - **Partner A:** `git push origin featureA`
   - **Partner B:** `git push origin featureB`
   - This sends your branch and its changes to your respective GitHub repositories.
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of the terminal showing using the git push command)**

### Part 4: Merging Feature A (Partner A)

**Partner A, back to you!**

1. **Switch to the main branch:**  
   -  `git checkout main`

2. **Merge your feature branch:**
   - `git merge featureA`

3. **Push the changes to GitHub:**
   -  `git push origin main`
   - Your "featureA" is now part of the main project! üéâ

---

### Part 5: Integrating Feature B (Partner B)

**Partner B, let's bring your feature in!**

1. **Fetch changes from the original repository:**
   - Add Partner A's original repository as a remote (if you haven't already): 
     -  `git remote add upstream <Partner A's original repository URL>`
   - Fetch changes from Partner A's main branch:
     -  `git fetch upstream main`
   - **(Add Image: Screenshot of terminal showing adding remote and fetching changes)**

2. **Merge the updated main branch into your feature branch:**
   -  `git checkout featureB`
   -  `git merge upstream/main` 
   -  This incorporates any changes Partner A made to the main branch while you were working. 

3. **Resolve merge conflicts (if any):**
   - **What's a merge conflict?** Sometimes, when merging branches, Git encounters conflicting changes. It'll mark these conflicts in your files, and you need to decide which changes to keep.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     This is the change I made on my branch (featureB).
     =======
     This is the change Partner A made on the main branch. 
     >>>>>>> upstream/main
     ```
   - You need to edit this section to choose one of the changes, or combine them:
     ```
     This is the final resolved change for both branches.
     ```
   -  After fixing conflicts, use `git add <filename>` to stage the resolved files.
   -  Commit the merge: `git commit -m "Merged upstream/main into featureB"` 
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of a merge conflict in a code editor and resolving it)**

4. **Push your merged branch:**
   -  `git push origin featureB` 

5. **Create a Pull Request:**
   -  Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   -  You'll see a banner suggesting to create a pull request for "featureB". Click it!
   -  **Best Practices:**
      - **Title:** Clear and concise, summarizing the change (e.g., "Add user authentication")
      - **Description:** Provide more context, explain your changes, and link to related issues if any. Use markdown for formatting!
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of creating a pull request on GitHub)**

### Part 6: Reviewing and Merging the Pull Request (Partner A)

**Partner A, one last step!**

1. **Review the Pull Request:**
   - Go to the "Pull requests" tab in **your original repository**.
   - You'll see Partner B's pull request.
   - **Careful Review:** Read the changes, leave comments, and discuss any questions or suggestions.
   -  **(Add Image: Screenshot of reviewing a pull request on GitHub)**

2. **Merge the Pull Request:**
   -  If everything looks good, click the big green "Merge pull request" button.
   - Congratulations! Both of your features are now part of the main project. üéâ
