| 6 | Front-end vs. Back-end| 1     | option1        | No issues. This question uses a helpful analogy to explain the concepts.                                                                                                                                      |
| 7 | Binary Notation        | 1     | option4        | **Incorrect Answer:** The correct answer should be "Each digit is represented by a single binary digit (0 or 1) and its position determines its value (powers of 2)."                                           |

| 12| If-Else              | 1     | option1        | **Ambiguous Question:** The question needs to specify what output is expected (e.g., print the total cost, print a message, etc.) and provide sample input (e.g., order amount).                             |
| 13| While Loop           | 1     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 17| Arrays & Manipulation| 1     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18| Arrays & Loops       | 1     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19| Operators             | 2     | option1        | **Incorrect Answer:** The correct answer is 40.6, not 41.6. Make sure the calculation in the code snippet matches the provided correct answer.                                                                 |
| 20| If-Else              | 2     | option2        | **Incorrect Answer:** The correct answer is option2, as `stockPrice` is less than 50 and `projectedGrowth` is greater than 10.                                                                                |
| 21| Nested Loops        | 3     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 22| Nested Loops & Break | 3     | option1        | **Incorrect Answer:** The code snippet will output: <br> 1 <br> 3. This is because the `if` condition within the nested loop will always evaluate to `false`, preventing the `break` statement from executing. |
| 23| Nested Loops        | 3     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 24| While Loop           | 3     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25| While Loop           | 3     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26| Arrays & Loops       | 3     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 27| Arrays & Loops       | 3     | option1        | **Typo in Question:** "Output of the" should be "output of the".                                                                                                                                             |
| 28| Arrays & Nested Loops| 3     | option2        | **Incorrect Answer:** The correct answer is option2. The first `console.log` inside the loop outputs 9, the second iteration encounters an error trying to access `arr[x+2]` when x is 4 (out of bounds). |
| 29| Arrays & Loops       | 3     | option1        | No issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Review and Correct Answers:** Carefully check each question's answer key, ensuring that option1 is always the correct answer as intended.
2. **Address Typos:** Proofread the entire assessment for typographical errors and inconsistencies in formatting.
3. **Clarify Ambiguous Questions:**  Provide more context and specific output requirements for questions like the shipping cost calculation (question 12).
4. **Increase Challenge:** Include a few more challenging questions that require deeper understanding and application of JavaScript concepts. For instance, questions involving function usage or more complex array manipulations would be beneficial. 
5. **Consider Code Formatting:** Use a code editor or IDE to format the code snippets consistently for better readability. You can copy and paste the code into a text editor that supports code formatting (like VS Code) and then copy the formatted code back into the table.

By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the quality and effectiveness of your JavaScript basics MCQ assessment.
