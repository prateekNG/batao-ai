## Step 1: Project Setup

This guide will walk you through building a simplified e-commerce website using React. We'll be utilizing functional components, hooks, and the Context API for state management. The goal is to give you hands-on experience with building dynamic user interfaces and handling data flow in a React application.

### Objectives

- **Initialize a new React project using Create React App.**
- **Install the necessary project dependencies.**
- **Structure the project directories for organizing components.**
- **Clean up unnecessary files generated by Create React App.**

Let's get started!

### 1.1 Initializing a New React Project

We will use Create React App, a convenient tool that sets up the basic structure of our React application.

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to your desired project directory.**
3. **Run the following command to create a new React app:**

```bash
npx create-react-app my-eshop
```

Replace `my-eshop` with your preferred project name. This command will generate a new folder with your project name containing the basic file structure of a React app.

4. **Navigate into your new project directory:**

```bash
cd my-eshop
```

### 1.2 Installing Project Dependencies

Our project requires several third-party libraries to implement specific features like UI components, routing, currency formatting, and Firebase integration.

1. **Make sure you are still inside your project directory in the terminal.**
2. **Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:**

```bash
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons react-router-dom react-currency-format firebase
```

This command will install the following libraries:

- **@material-ui/core & @material-ui/icons:** For using pre-built UI components from Material-UI.
- **react-router-dom:** For implementing routing and navigation between different pages (Home, Checkout, Login).
- **react-currency-format:** For formatting currency values.
- **firebase:** For backend services, including user authentication.

### 1.3 Structuring Project Folders

Organizing our project files is essential for maintainability. We'll create a dedicated folder for our React components.

1. **Inside your `src` folder, create a new folder named `components`.**

2. **Create the following files within the `src/components` directory:**
    - `Header.js`
    - `Home.js`
    - `Checkout.js`
    - `Product.js`
    - `Subtotal.js`
    - `Login.js`
    - `CheckoutProduct.js`

### 1.4 Cleaning Up Unnecessary Files

Create React App generates some files we won't be using in this project. Let's remove them.

1. **Delete the following files from the `src` folder:**
    - `App.test.js`
    - `logo.svg`
    - `setupTests.js`

You have now successfully set up the foundation for your React e-commerce application! You've initialized a new project, included all the necessary libraries, organized your project structure, and are ready to move on to building the UI components.
