3) ## Common mistakes and misconceptions about objects.

   1. Misunderstanding Dot Notation and Bracket Notation.

   2. Assuming Objects Are Always Passed by Reference.

   3. Confusion Between Object and Array Methods: Thinking that objects can be manipulated in the same way as arrays, leading to errors or unexpected results.

   4. Misunderstanding of Object Cloning: Using assignment (=) to copy an object, resulting in a shallow copy where nested objects are still referenced. Believing that assignment creates a deep copy of an object, leading to unintentional shared references between objects.

   5. Incorrect Use of this Keyword.

   6. Overlooking Object Property Enumeration: Assuming that object properties are iterated in a specific order when using for...in the loop, leading to unreliable code.

   7. Neglecting Prototype Chain in Inheritance: Modifying properties or methods of a parent object directly, unintentionally affecting all child objects sharing the same prototype. (optional)

4) ## Letâ€™s put our knowledge to the test.

   1. ðŸ¥ŠTest the [basic understanding of the concepts](https://chat.openai.com/share/eeb240cc-dbbe-45f2-9cc1-c87279afadb3) and theory.

   3. ðŸ¥ŠPractice [coding problems](https://chat.openai.com/share/aafa50d1-98a1-4312-a3d5-b902a3584d8a) creating functional objects with different properties and methods. (e.g., coding problems involving object creation and manipulation)

   4. ðŸ¥Š[Identify and correct errors](https://chat.openai.com/share/3293899e-b1eb-4bf2-99ca-c2fb1acb7db4) in given object implementations. (e.g., debugging exercises where learners fix mistakes in object-related code)

   5. ðŸ¥ŠCheck your understanding of objects through [multiple-choice questions](https://chat.openai.com/share/970fdf89-67d7-497e-abd9-1c185cc4a3a1). (e.g., quiz questions to assess comprehension of object concepts)

   6. ðŸ¥ŠRead the code and [figure out the output](https://chat.openai.com/share/27a81e00-527e-43e4-8114-0bfca4743fa6) of a given code snippet.
