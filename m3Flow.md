Imagine you and your friend have brought different snacks for lunch. However, you want to exchange your snacks with each other. To do this, you decide to enlist the help of a friend who can hold one snack box while you exchange with your other friend. Similarly, in programming, we can use a third variable to help us swap the values of two variables.

Write a program to take two values from the user and swap them.

Hint: You can use a third variable.

1. Think about how you would exchange snack boxes with your friend and the helper.
2. Pay attention to the role of the helper in facilitating the swap.

Logical order of statements (existing challenge)
Flowchart
Imagine you're working as a payroll manager in a company, and your job is to calculate the gross salary of employees based on their basic salary and certain allowances. The gross salary includes the basic salary along with House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Dearness Allowance (DA), which vary based on the employee's basic salary range.

Write a program to take the basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross salary according to the following: (Gross salary is the sum of basic salary, HRA, and DRA)
Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%

Tips:

1. Understand the different allowance percentages based on the employee's basic salary range.
2. Pay attention to how the gross salary is calculated by adding the basic salary, HRA, and DA.
3. Ensure accuracy in calculations and handle different basic salary scenarios effectively.


Test Case1:
Input:
17000
Output:
36550
Explanation:
Since the basic salary lies in the bracket 10000 <= basic salary <= 20000, the HRA equals 25% of the salary = 4250, and the DRA equals 90% of the basic salary = 15300. Hence the total salary is 17000+15300+4250 = 36550

Factors question

Flowchart
Write a program to check if a number is a special type of number called a 'prime number'. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself, and it doesn't have any other factors.
For example, the number 7 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 7 without leaving a remainder. However, the number 12 is not a prime number because it has other factors, such as 2, 3, 4, and 6, in addition to 1 and 12. (Take the number from the user)? Learn sieve algorithm

Test Case1:
Input:
97
Output:
Yes

Test Case2:
Input:

Output:
No

Flowchart
Write a program to take a number from the user and then determine if that number is a special type of number called a 'perfect number'.
A perfect number is a number where the sum of all its factors (excluding the number itself) is equal to the number itself. Print Yes if the number is a perfect number else print No.

Test Case1:
Input:
6
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
The program takes the number 6 as input. It then calculates the factors of 6, which are 1, 2, and 3. The sum of these factors (1 + 2 + 3) is equal to 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

Test Case2:
Input:
12
Output:
No
Explanation:
The program takes the number 12 as input. It calculates the factors of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The sum of these factors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6)
is equal to 16, which is not equal to 12. Therefore, 12 is not a perfect number.
