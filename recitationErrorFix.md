The error message "Candidate was blocked due to RECITATION" indicates that your Gemini API request was blocked because the generated response was considered too similar to the input prompt. This usually happens when:

* **Your prompt is overly specific and instructs the model to simply repeat the input.** For example, asking the model to "Summarize the following text:" followed by a large block of text.
* **The model is trained on a dataset where the training data is similar to your prompt.** If you're asking the model to generate something that is already present in its training data, it might trigger the RECITATION block.

Here's how to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

**1. Reframe your prompt:**

* **Avoid direct instructions to repeat or summarize:** Instead of asking for a summary, ask for a specific aspect of the text you want the model to focus on.
* **Use more open-ended questions:** Instead of "Summarize this text," ask "What are the key takeaways from this text?" or "What are the main arguments presented in this text?"
* **Provide context and ask for specific output:** Instead of "Write a story," ask "Write a story about a young girl who discovers a magical portal in her backyard."

**2. Check your input:**

* **Avoid excessive repetition or paraphrasing:** Make sure your input is diverse and original.
* **Ensure your input is grammatically correct and coherent:** A well-structured prompt is less likely to trigger the RECITATION block.

**3. Experiment with different prompt formats:**

* **Try using a different prompt style:** Instead of a single-line prompt, try breaking it down into smaller, more focused prompts.
* **Use a conversational style:** Ask questions as you would in a normal conversation.

**4. Consider using different models:**

* **Gemini Pro:** Try using a different model like Gemini Pro, which might have a higher tolerance for repetition.
* **Experiment with other models:** Explore other models from Google or other providers that might be better suited for your task.

**5. Review the Gemini API documentation:**

* **Check the guidelines and best practices:** Make sure you're not violating any rules or limitations.
* **Look for information about the RECITATION block:** The documentation might provide more context about the block and how to avoid triggering it.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Use a tool like "Prompt Engineering" to help you craft better prompts.**
* **Run a test with a smaller input:** This can help you identify potential issues with your prompt before submitting a larger request.
* **Be patient and keep experimenting:** It might take some trial and error to find the right prompt for your specific task.

By understanding the reasons behind the RECITATION block and implementing the suggestions above, you should be able to resolve this issue and successfully use the Gemini API for your desired purposes.
