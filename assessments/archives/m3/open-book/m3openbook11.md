1. John earns a salary and is subject to different tax rates based on his income. The tax rates are as follows:

    Up to 10,000: 5% tax


    10,001 to 20,000: 10% tax


    20,001 to 30,000: 15% tax


    Above 30,000: 20% tax


    Write a program that prompts John to enter his income and calculate the amount of tax he owes.


    **Input:**


    An integer representing John's income.


    **Output:**


    The amount of tax John owes is represented in one line


    John's income will be a non-negative integer.


    **Testcase 1:**


    **Input:**


    8,000.


    **Output:**


    400


    Explanation: Since 8000 is up to 10,000, the tax rate is 5%. Therefore, the tax is 400.


    **Testcase 2:**


    **Input:**


    15,000


    **Output:**


    1500


    Explanation: From 10,001 to 20,000 is taxed at 10%, Therefore, 10% of 15000 = 1500.


    **Testcase 3:**


    **Input:**


    25,000


    **Output:**


    3750


    Explanation: From 20,001 to 30,000, the tax is 15%. Therefore, the tax is 15% of 25000 = 3750.

2. You are given an integer N representing the total of seconds. Write a program to convert the given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.

    **Input:**


    The input consists of a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9) representing the number of seconds.


    **Output:**


    Output three integers separated by a space representing the hours, minutes, and remaining seconds respectively.


    **Testcase 1:**


    **Input:**


    3665


    **Output:**


    1 1 5


    **Testcase 2:**


    **Input:**


    876


    **Output:**


    0 14 36


    **Testcase 3:**


    **Input:**


    24367


    **Output:**


    6 46 7


    Explanations:


    Testcase 1: 3665 seconds is equivalent to 1 hour, 1 minute, and 5 seconds.


    Testcase 2: 876 seconds is equivalent to 0 hours, 14 minutes, and 36 seconds.


    Testcase 3: 24367 seconds is equivalent to 6 hours, 46 minutes, and 7 seconds.

3. You are given a positive integer N and an array of integers. Write a program to print the sum of the first N elements of the array.

    **Input:**


    The input consists of a single positive integer N and an array of length L. Each element of the array.


    **Output:**


    Output a single integer representing the sum of the first N elements of the array.


    **Testcase 1:**


    **Input:**


    N = 3 


    L = 5


    Array = [10, -5, 8, -3, 2]


    **Output:**


    13


    Explanation: The first 3 elements of the array are 10, -5, and 8. Their sum is 10 + (-5) + 8 = 13.


    **Testcase 2:**


    **Input:**


    N = 4 


    L = 4


    Array = [-2, -4, -6, -8]


    **Output:**


    -20


    **Testcase 3:**


    **Input:**


    N = 1 


    L = 1


    Array = [1000]


    **Output:**


    1000


    Explanation: The first (and only) element of the array is 1000. Hence, the sum is 1000."
