# Gemini Interaction Script

This Node.js script interacts with Google's Gemini generative AI model to generate text content based on a given input prompt. The input prompt is read from a specified file, and the generated response is written to an output file.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- NPM package `@google/generative-ai` installed
- Google Gemini API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Install the required NPM package:

```sh
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

## Usage

1. Set up your environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key.
2. Prepare an input file containing the prompt you want to use.
3. Run the script with the input file, output file, and optional temperature as arguments:

```sh
node gemini-interact.js <input_file> <output_file> <temperature>
```

- `<input_file>`: Path to the file containing the input prompt.
- `<output_file>`: Path to the file where the generated response will be saved.
- `<temperature>`: (Optional) A number between 0 and 1 that controls the randomness of the output. The default value is 0.7.

### Example

```sh
node gemini-interact.js input.txt output.txt 0.5
```

This command reads the prompt from `input.txt`, generates a response using the Gemini model with a temperature of 0.5, and writes the response to `output.txt`.

## Script Details

- The script reads the input prompt from the specified input file.
- It creates an instance of the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class using the provided API key.
- The script configures the Gemini model with the specified temperature.
- It generates text content using the configured Gemini model.
- The generated response is written to the specified output file.

### Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling to catch and log any issues that occur during execution.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is correctly set with your API key before running the script.
- The default temperature value is set to 0.7 if not provided as an argument.
- The script currently requires a minimum of two arguments (input file and output file). If not provided, it will display an error message and usage instructions.
