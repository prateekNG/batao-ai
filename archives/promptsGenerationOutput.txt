Here's a possible sequence of prompts a first-time programming student learning JavaScript might ask an AI to understand "break" and "continue" statements, building upon their existing knowledge of loops:

**Prompt 1: Encountering a Problem**

```
Okay, I'm trying to write a program using a while loop that asks the user to input numbers. I want the loop to stop if the user enters the number '0'. How do I do that? Here’s the code I’ve written so far:

```javascript
let num = 1;
while(num != 0){
    //Take input from user and store it in variable 'num'
}
console.log("Loop Finished!") 
```

**Prompt 2: Introduction to "break"**

```
That's great! The 'break' statement helps me exit the loop immediately. Can you explain with the example I just tried to code? Also, please show the corrected code with the output. 
```

**Prompt 3:  "break" in Different Loops**

```
Got it. Does ‘break’ work the same way with other loops like ‘for’ loops too? If yes, can you show an example of how 'break' would work inside a 'for' loop, maybe for a program that finds the first even number in a list?
```

**Prompt 4: A New Challenge - Skipping Iterations**

```
This 'break' statement is really helpful! But what if, instead of completely stopping the loop when I find an even number, I just want to skip over it and continue checking the rest of the numbers in the list?
```

**Prompt 5: Introducing "continue"**

```
Interesting! The 'continue' statement sounds like what I need. Can you show me how to use 'continue' in the same 'for' loop example where I'm finding even numbers? Like, instead of printing the even number, I want to just skip to the next number in the list. 
```

**Prompt 6: "break" vs. "continue"**

```
So, 'break' stops the loop entirely, and 'continue' just skips to the next iteration. Can you summarize the main differences between 'break' and 'continue' with simple examples? I want to be sure when to use which one.
```

**Prompt 7: Nested Loops and "break"**

```
What happens if I have a 'break' statement inside a loop that's nested inside another loop? Does it break out of both loops or just the inner one? Explain with a simple example, please.
```

**Prompt 8:  Real-World Applications**

```
These 'break' and 'continue' statements are quite handy! Can you give me some real-world examples of where we use them in programming, maybe something relatable to everyday life in India? 
```

This sequence of prompts follows a natural progression, simulating how a student might learn about "break" and "continue" statements:

* It starts with a concrete problem the student is facing, making the need for a new concept apparent.
* The AI introduces the concept in a timely and relevant manner.
* The student then explores the concept further through examples, comparisons, and applications in different contexts.
* Finally, the student seeks to understand the concept's relevance and application in real-world scenarios.
